# 01-student-challenge 
The first assignment for UT Bootcamp

## Description
The first student challenge addresses issues of accessibility. I edited code (html and css) to better align with current accesibility standards. I learned about what standards are in place and how to translate those standards into usable code on a website. I also combined some repetitive code to avoid being DRY. I made the website somewhat responsive with media queries. In the future, I would like to do more with media queries and pseudo elements. Here are some pics of what the responsive site looks like (specifically on an iPhone SE)
