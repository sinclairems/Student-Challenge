# 01-student-challenge Urban-Octo-Telegram
The first assignment for UT Bootcamp

## Description
The first student challenge addresses issues of accessibility. I edited code (html and css) to better align with current accesibility standards. I learned about what standards are in place and how to use translate those standards into usable code on a website. There are many other things that could be done to make this website even more accessible, including making it responsive to different types of screens.
